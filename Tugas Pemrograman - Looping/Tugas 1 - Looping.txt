1. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number. (Note: An even number is prime if it is 2. An odd integer is prime if it is not divisible by any odd integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.) 
2. Condider a sequence : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144,... This sequence characterized by the fact that every number in it is the sum of the two preceding ones. Create a program that prompt the user to input the length of the sequence, and output the sequence according to the length. 
3. Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs both the individual digits of the number and the sum of the digits. For example, it should output the individual digits of 3456 as 3 4 5 6 , output the individual digits of 8030 as 8 0 3 0 , output the individual digits of 2345526 as 2 3 4 5 5 2 6 , output the individual digits of 4000 as 4 0 0 0, and output the individual digits of -2345 as 2 3 4 5 . Also the sum of those number.
