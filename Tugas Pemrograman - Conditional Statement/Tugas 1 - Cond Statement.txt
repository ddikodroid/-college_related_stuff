1.Write a program that prompts the user to input three numbers. The program should then output the numbers in ascending order. 
2.A box of cookies can hold 24 cookies, and a container can hold 75 boxes of cookies. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the total number of cookies, the number of cookies in a box, and the number of cookie boxes in a container. The program then outputs the number of boxes and the number of containers to ship the cookies. Note that each box must contain the specified number of cookies, and each container must contain the specified number of boxes. If the last box of cookies contains less than the number of specified cookies, you can discard it and output the number of leftover cookies. Similarly, if the last container contains less than the number of specified boxes, you can discard it and output the number of leftover boxes. 
3.Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input two integers and the operation to be performed. It should then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if the denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.) Some sample outputs follow: 3 + 4 = 7 13 * 5 = 65
